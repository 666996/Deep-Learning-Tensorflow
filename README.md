# Deep-Learning-Tensorflow
### Purely Tensorflow, no Keras or other abstract libraries of Tensorflow

## Dependencies
```bash
sudo pip install scipy numpy matplotlib librosa pandas seaborn
```
- I recommended install Tensorflow even for CPU / GPU from source, way more faster. You can read more [here on how to install.](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_sources)
- If you got GPU, compile it with CUDA. You can read more [here on how to install.](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_sources#configure_the_installation)
- You need to download CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100
